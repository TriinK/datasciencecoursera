# Practical machine learning course assignment

## Synopsis
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

This assignment was built up in RStudio, using its knitr functions, meant to be published in html format. The main goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants performed some exercise as described below. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. The machine learning algorithm described here is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data and the predictions are submitted in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.

## Data processing
## Obtaining data

The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

### Reading files

```{r read_file, echo = TRUE}
filepath1 <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
filepath2 <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

if(!file.exists("pml-training.csv")) {
  download.file(filepath1, destfile = "pml-training.csv")
}

if(!file.exists("pml-testing.csv")) {
  download.file(filepath2, destfile = "pml-testing.csv")
}
test <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
```

### Cleaning data

In this section columns that contain NAs or are empty are removed. First seven features are not numeric (related to the time-series)

```{r clean_data, echo = TRUE}
features <- names(test[,colSums(is.na(test)) == 0])[8:46]

# Since test and training sets are compared, use only features that are present in the testing set.
training <- training[,c(features,"classe")]
test <- test[,c(features,"problem_id")]
```

### Create partitions

For machine training session one must create partitions for it first. In this case 70% training set and 30% testing set will be created from the dataset provided.

```{r partitions, echo = TRUE}
library(caret)
Partitions  <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
Train_set <- training[Partitions, ]
Test_set  <- training[-Partitions, ]
dim(Train_set)
dim(Test_set)
```

### Correlation analysis

```{r correlations, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
#Plot
library(corrgram)
corrgram(Train_set, order=FALSE, lower.panel=panel.shade, upper.panel=panel.pie, text.panel=panel.txt, col.regions=colorRampPalette(c("red","salmon","white","royalblue","navy")), main="Correlation of remaining features")
```
Only few very dark correlation can be found.

## Model selection
Two models will be used in this data analysis: random forests and decision trees. Confusion matrices are plotted to show their accuracy.

### Random forest analysis on the training dataset
```{r rf_training, echo = TRUE}
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
set.seed(12345)
random_forest_model <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = Train_set, ntree = 1000, na.action =na.exclude)

#Use prediction on testing set of training set result
prediction <- predict(random_forest_model, Test_set, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(prediction, Test_set$classe)
```
### Out-of-sample error for random forest
```{r rf_testing, echo = TRUE}
sum(prediction != Test_set$classe) / length(Test_set$classe)
```

It seems that the out-of-sample error is **0.22 % ** for the training subset "Test_set"

### Random forest analysis result on the testing dataset
```{r rf_prediction, echo = TRUE}
predict(random_forest_model, test, type = "class")
```

### Train a decision tree model
```{r dt, echo = TRUE}
library(rattle)
library(rpart)
#Create random sample without NAs
set.seed(55555)
#training <- Train_set[ , colSums(is.na(Train_set)) == 0]
rand_sample <- Train_set[sample(1:nrow(Train_set), 100, replace = FALSE), ]

#Train random sample using decision tree with principal componend analysis
dt_mod <- rpart(classe~., data=rand_sample, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(dt_mod)
```

Decision tree model shows somewhat equal prediction amongst classes.

### Use decision tree on test-set and plot a confusion matrix
```{r dt_testset, echo = TRUE}
dt_model <- rpart(classe~., data=Test_set, method="class")
prediction_dt <- predict(dt_model, Test_set, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(prediction_dt, Test_set$classe)
```
### Out-of-sample error for decision tree

```{r dt_testing, echo = TRUE}
sum(prediction_dt != Test_set$classe) / length(Test_set$classe)
```

## 20 different test case prediction
```{r prediction_20, echo = TRUE}
predict_test <- predict(random_forest_model, newdata=test)
test$problem_id <- predict_test
result <- data.frame(problem_id = test$problem_id, classe = predict_test)
head(result)
```

## Results

As you can see from the confusion matrix of the rando forest, the accuracy is very high (99.78%) with very high confidence intervals and low P-values. The resulting low out-of-sample error (0.22%) seems too good to be true. However decision tree results show 98.11 % accuracy with equally low P-values while out-of-sample error is higher (1.89%). This shows that random forest is a better option in this case for model selection.
